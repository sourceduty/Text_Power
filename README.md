### Example Text, Docs and Books

The Book of Small by Emily Carr

Rating: ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ (6/10)

The Book of Small offers insight into early 20th-century Canadian life, with strong social commentary woven through descriptions of family, community, and cultural norms. Social power is evident in the rigid family hierarchies and the influence of religious practices on everyday activities. The text highlights the father's authoritative role and the way traditional gender roles shape family dynamics, reflecting the social expectations of the period. Politically, the work doesn't directly engage in activism but subtly critiques social conventions. Financial power appears more subtly through references to material items, the structure of household maintenance, and class distinctions seen in characters' behaviors and possessions. These themes collectively critique the constrained lives of women and children in this era, showcasing how societal norms shape individual choices.

The guidelines exert social power by prioritizing participant welfare, impacting public health standards and patient rights globally. Financially, the ICH’s guidelines affect pharmaceutical companies, necessitating investments in compliance and quality management to meet these standards, shaping research costs, and operational models. The document's mandates for transparency and participant safety illustrate a profound influence over the ethical and financial landscape of clinical research.
